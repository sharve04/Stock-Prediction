# Stock Price Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the stock price of a specific company using historical stock price data and machine learning techniques. Stock price prediction is a fundamental problem in financial analysis and can have a significant impact on investment decisions. In this repository, we provide an example of how to predict a company's stock price using historical data and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model.

## Overview

- **Data Source**: Historical stock price data for the company (e.g., Apple Inc.) is fetched from a reliable source (e.g., Yahoo Finance).

- **Data Preprocessing**: The historical stock price data is preprocessed to prepare it for modeling. This may include scaling, splitting into training and testing sets, and creating sequences for the LSTM model.

- **Model Building**: We use a deep learning model, specifically an LSTM neural network, to learn patterns in the historical data and make predictions about future stock prices.

- **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess its accuracy and reliability in making stock price predictions.

- **Visualization**: The predicted stock prices are visualized alongside the actual stock prices to better understand the model's performance.

## How to Use

1. **Data Collection**: You need to obtain historical stock price data for the company you are interested in. You can use APIs, web scraping, or other data sources to collect this data.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Modify the code to preprocess your data. Ensure that it is in a suitable format for input to the LSTM model.

3. **Model Building**: You can use the provided example code as a starting point, or adapt it to your specific dataset. Consider hyperparameter tuning and architecture adjustments for better model performance.

4. **Evaluation**: Use appropriate evaluation metrics to assess the model's accuracy and make necessary improvements.

5. **Visualization**: Visualize the model's predictions alongside actual stock prices to better understand its performance.
